# Project Requirement Specification

## Problem Statement
Since JHU has many students coming and leaving each year, there is a big 2nd hand goods market, but there isn’t any app like Craglist to help students or professors to sell their stuff. 

## Potential Clients
JHU students, professors, and whoever has a JHU email.

## Proposed Solution
A web app for people to post, browse and buy second-hand stuff. 


## Functional Requirements 

**Must-have** 
* As a user, I would want to login into the platform so I can access my past activities  
* As a user, I should be able to sign up an account so I can log in  
* As a user, I should be able to create posts so that I can buy/sell things  
* As a user, I want to be able include text in the post so that I can describe things  
* As a user, I can sign in to post an item with tags for its category so a buyer can search through category  
* As a user, I should be able to search for the item/service that I am interested so that I don’t have to see things that I don’t want  
* As a user, I want to be able to include image in the post so that I can show other users more clearly  
* As a user, I want to be able to edit my posts after I post so that I can update the post when I feel like to  
* As a user, I should be able to mark something as sold so that selling information is kept up to date.  
* As a user, I should be able to browse items by category so that I can search for specific things to buy.  
* As a user, I would like to be able click on a specific post so that I can see the details of the item  
* As a user, it would be nice to have the chatting feature so that I can coordinate with the person on the other end  
* As a user, I would like to be able to pay for my purchase through the website to keep transactions secure.  


**Nice-to-have**
* As a user, I would want to login into the platform using my JHED account to verify my identity.  
* As a user, I want the system to tell me what object I am trying to sell using computer vision probably, so that I wouldn’t be confused about what hashtag to use.  
* As a user I should be able to see other people’s location information so I can buy from others close to me.  
* As a user I would like to be able to make a wish list so I can show people what things I am looking for  
* As a user, I want to be able to sort by recently added, oldest, recently discounted, etc., so I can see if there is anything I would like to buy that I otherwise wouldn't have seen.
